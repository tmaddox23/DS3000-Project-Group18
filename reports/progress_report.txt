Phase Two – Progress Report
Problem Definition & Motivation

Counterfeit products and buyer scams pose a significant and growing challenge in online marketplaces. 
Fraudulent listing can cause financial and safety risks to buyers and can damage platform credibility. 
With increasing transaction volumes and millions of sellers, manually detecting counterfeit goods becomes 
unrealistic; this would be very inefficient and prone to human error. Our project aims to address this issue 
by developing a machine-learning based system capable of automatically identifying counterfeit products and 
transactions using behavioral, transactional, and seller-related features. This work is motivated by the 
importance of platform trust and the need for scalable and data driven solutions to fraud detection in 
real-world ecommerce environments.

Objective & Goals

Our primary objective is to build a supervised classification model that predicts whether 
a product or transaction involves counterfeit activity. 

•	Conduct exploratory data analysis on both datasets to understand trends, anomalies, correlations and potential fraud indicators.
•	Preprocess the dataset through encoding, normalization, and construction of temporal features (“time” like transaction date), creating derived features and exploring whether merging the two datasets improves performance.
•	Compare multiple machine learning models to identify the strongest performer based on our objective evaluation metrics.
•	Evaluate the model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC, allowing for measurable objectives between models for detecting counterfeit cases.
•	Produce a final system that highlights the most important predictive signals (seller rating, price anomalies, geolocation mismatch ex. Same seller in multiple areas).

Proposed Methods & Feasibility

We have chosen and explored two complementary datasets. Our datasets include “buyer data” (transactional). 
Our target variable involves_counterfeit . “Seller data” (product and behavior), our target variable 
is_counterfeit. Our initial data analysis confirmed that both sets are high quality, well structured, 
and capture distinct dimensions of counterfeit behavior. We have begun identifying potentially 
predictive features such as seller_rating, shipping_time_days, domain_age_days, and geolocation mismatch.
We plan to preprocess each dataset using categorical one-hot encoding and normalization for numerical 
ones. Our modeling approach involves training separate models on each dataset and comparing their performance.
During initial exploration, we evaluated the feasibility of merging the datasets to build a unified feature 
space. However, the datasets don’t share any common keys, and so we will proceed by treating the two datasets
as independent supervised learning problems, each providing a different perspective on counterfeit activity. 
We plan to use logistic regression (fast and handles relationships well), random forest (handles mixed 
datatypes), gradient boosting (tubular and structured datasets, known in fraud detection systems),
KNN (captures local patterns), and SVM. All methods are feasible for structured data and are well aligned
with our goals. Checking multiple models will allow us to determine the best performer based on what we
consider the most important objective: speed, generalization, interpretability, and sensitivity. Through 
proper data selection we have validated that both datasets support training without requiring major cleaning
or manipulation.
